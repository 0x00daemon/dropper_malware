## Note: 
***Please run this inside a windows VM. It is not recommended at all, to run this in your host machine. Run at your own risk if not running inside a VM.***

## Overview

The Dropper Application is a unique project that combines the appearance and functionality of a calculator with an unconventional twist. While it presents itself as a calculator on the front end, behind the scenes, it performs an operation that may sound malicious but is, in fact, completely harmless. Instead of deploying any harmful software, it downloads and copies a benign program from the PuTTY family called "pterm," which is a terminal emulator.

ðŸŽ­ **A Playful Deception**

This application demonstrates the intriguing concept of camouflaging benign activities within the facade of something potentially nefarious. It serves as a playful experiment to illustrate how appearances can be deceiving and challenge preconceptions about software behavior.

## Key Features

- ðŸ§® **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Calculator**: The Dropper Application boasts a fully functional calculator interface, complete with arithmetic operations.

- âœ… **Innocuous Operation**: Contrary to its misleading presentation, the application does not engage in any harmful or malicious activities. Instead, it performs an entirely benign operation.

- ðŸš€ **Startup Folder Manipulation**: After the benign operation, the application copies the harmless program (pterm) to the Windows startup folder. Anything placed in this folder is executed automatically every time Windows starts up, similar to applications like Discord that launch on startup.


## Getting Started

To explore and run the Dropper Application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Download the NightHawks Calculator 7zip file.

2. Extract the setup using 7zip.

3. Run the setup file.

4. Run the calculator from the desktop shortcut created.

5. Check the pterm application in the startup folder which can be access using the run application (windows + r) and type shell:startup to access the startup folder.

6. Restart the VM and either windows defender is going to delete it from the startup folder or the pterm terminal will open.

**Note:** The Dropper Application is meant to stimulate discussion and exploration within the realm of software development. It does not endorse or promote malicious behavior in any way. Use it responsibly and for educational purposes only.
